# Calculator

    This is a final project for the Foundations course, an introductory course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    I will go to reuse a web-template which I created before to improve my skills in HTML and CSS.

    Abilities for this project I need to have:

    - add
    - subtract
    - multiply
    - divide

    Steps How I'go to do it(To do list):

    1. Store all components on HTML to JS.
    2. Assign global variable.
    3. Create function witch can use actual button numbers and display them. (I decide to lock displaying max 10 numbers on screen!)
    - After couple of ours searching how can i do this step, learned that can be done with text.COntent, which use the text content form the button already assigned in HTML.

    Next to do:
    4. Create another function now for operators. -done.
    5. Add functionality for other buttons Clear-all, delete, equal, decimal. -done.
    6. Then need to connect everything together to calculate. 

    I think this project is done. Was huge project for me but I've learned much more how to use JS, specially DOM.
